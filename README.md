# Horiseon Browser Homepage Optimization

## Description

This project serves as an activity that tests and strengthens basic skills such as reading and interpreting code.  To optimize this webpage for accessibility and HTML semantics, we were challenged to understand the code we were reading while also being able to consolidate code to make it more efficient.  

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The links on the page work to point you to the named sections.  Additionally the images all, except the main image declared on CSS, have an alt tag to improve accessibility.
